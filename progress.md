This document outlines the progress of the SentyAI project.

## Current Status: Prototype Complete

We have successfully completed the initial prototype of the SentyAI application. The prototype is fully interactive and demonstrates the core user flow, from data collection to document generation.

### Completed Features:

- **10-Step Company Setup Wizard:** A comprehensive, multi-step questionnaire to collect all the necessary company information.
- **Dynamic Progress Bar:** A progress bar that visually tracks the user's progress through the wizard.
- **Structured Data Inputs:** The wizard uses dropdowns, checkboxes, and a searchable country list to ensure data quality and improve user experience.
- **User-Facing Features:** The first step of the wizard includes fields for the user's name and email, a "Terms and Conditions" checkbox, and a simulated email confirmation.
- **Document Dashboard:** A central hub for viewing and managing the generated documents, with a sidebar for navigation and a main content area for the document content.
- **Realistic AI Simulation:** The application now collects the data from the wizard and uses it to generate realistic-looking documents with dynamic content.

### Next Steps:

- **Full AI Integration:** The next major step is to replace the simulated AI generation with a real API call to the Google AI model.
- **Backend Development:** To turn this prototype into a real product, we will need to build a secure backend to store user and company data.
- **AI Assistant:** After the initial AI integration, we will implement the "AI Assistant" feature to allow for interactive editing and refinement of the generated documents.
