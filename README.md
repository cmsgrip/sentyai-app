SentyAI is a prototype for a web-based application that helps businesses of all sizes streamline their documentation, compliance, and content creation.

- **Dynamic Progress Bar:** A visual indicator of the user's progress through the setup wizard.
- **Structured Data Inputs:** The wizard uses dropdowns, checkboxes, and a searchable country list to ensure data quality and improve user experience.
- **Document Dashboard:** A central hub for viewing and managing the generated documents, with a sidebar for navigation and a main content area for the document content.
- **Realistic AI Simulation:** The application simulates AI document generation by using the data from the wizard to populate document templates.
