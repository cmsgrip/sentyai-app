# SentyAI Conversation History

This document summarizes the conversation and key decisions made during the development of the SentyAI prototype.

## 1. Initial Concept & Feature Request

- The user requested the development of a standalone software application to help companies manage their documentation and content creation.
- Key features requested:
    - A form for companies to input their information.
    - Document upload functionality.
    - AI-powered document generation.
    - A review and edit feature for generated documents.
    - AI-powered website content generation.

## 2. Initial Prototype Development

- I created an initial prototype of the SentyAI application, including:
    - A basic HTML structure with a welcome screen.
    - A simple, one-step setup wizard.
    - A placeholder for the AI document generation screen.

## 3. Master Questionnaire Framework

- The user provided a detailed, 10-step "master questionnaire framework" to be used for data collection.
- I implemented this framework as a multi-step wizard with a progress bar.
- I also added a searchable country dropdown and structured data inputs (dropdowns, checkboxes) to improve user experience.

## 4. User Authentication & Terms of Service

- The user requested the addition of fields for the person filling the form (name and email).
- I added a "Terms and Conditions" checkbox and a simulated email confirmation to the first step of the wizard.

## 5. Document Dashboard & AI Integration Plan

- The user requested that the final, AI-generated documents be presented in a professional, well-designed template, similar to the `MomiPro SOPs1.html` file.
- I proposed the concept of a "Document Dashboard" to display the generated documents, with a sidebar for navigation and a main content area for the document content.
- The user also requested the ability to add new, custom documents to the dashboard.
- We agreed on a plan to implement a realistic simulation of the AI generation, where the application would collect data from the wizard and use it to populate document templates.
